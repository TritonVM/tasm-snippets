    /// Many of the snippets defined in this TASM library are critical for the
    /// consensus logic of the blockchain [Neptune Cash](https://neptune.cash).
    /// Therefore, it is paramount that the snippets are free of errors. In order
    /// to catch as many errors as possible, the snippets are reviewed by as many
    /// developers as possible. The requirements of such a review are listed here.
    ///
    /// A reviewer can (and should) sign off on any snippet they have reviewed and
    /// for which they found no defects. This is done by adding that snippet's
    /// [fingerprint] (at the time) to the overriding implementation of this method
    /// on that snippet.
    ///
    /// Together with the tools [`git blame`][blame] and cryptographic
    /// [signing] of commits, this makes sign-offs traceable. It also guarantees
    /// that changes to snippets that have already been signed-off are easy to
    /// detect.
    ///
    /// # For Reviewers
    ///
    /// ## Modifying snippets
    ///
    /// While the primary intention of the review process is to _review_ a snippet,
    /// there are circumstances under which modifying it is acceptable.
    ///
    /// Modifying a snippet to simplify reviewing that snippet is fair game. A
    /// common example of this case is replacing a `swap`-juggle chain with a few
    /// `pick`s & `place`s.
    ///
    /// Modifying a snippet in order to improve performance should only happen if
    /// the performance impact is meaningful. The currently agreed-upon threshold
    /// is 0.5% of at least one consensus program.
    ///
    /// It is acceptable, and can be desired, to modify a snippet by including
    /// assumption checks. For example, if the snippet's pre-conditions require
    /// some input to fall within a certain range, it is fine to add a corresponding
    /// range check to the snippet.
    /// Removing existing checks of such nature is considered bad practice.
    ///
    /// In either case, modifying a snippet that has already been reviewed and
    /// signed off by someone else in a way that alters its [fingerprint] requires
    /// their consent.
    ///
    /// ## Checklist
    ///
    /// Use the following checklist to guide your review. Signing off on a snippet
    /// means that in your eyes, all points on this checklist are true.
    ///
    /// - the snippet's documentation lists pre- and post-conditions
    /// - the snippet makes no assumptions outside the stated pre-conditions
    /// - given all pre-conditions, all post-conditions are met
    /// - whenever this snippet calls another snippet, all of that other snippet's
    ///   pre-conditions are met
    /// - all dynamic memory offsets are range-checked before they are used
    /// - each field accessor is used at most once per struct instance, or
    ///   range-checked before each use
    /// - reading from non-deterministically initialized memory only happens from
    ///   the region specified in the [memory convention]
    /// - memory-writes only happen outside of page 0 (see [memory convention])
    ///
    /// ## Documentation Template
    ///
    /// If a snippet you are reviewing is not (properly) documented yet, you can use
    /// the following template to document the type implementing [`BasicSnippet`].
    ///
    /// ````text
