//! Memory convention used in this crate:
//!
//! - A memory page is contiguous memory of size 2^32 words, aligned to 2^32 word boundaries.
//!     There is one exception: due to the [base field's prime][prime] being 2^64 - 2^32 + 1,
//!     the last page, starting at address 2^64 - 2^32, is of size 1.
//! - The dynamic allocator lives at address [`DYN_MALLOC_ADDRESS`][dyn_malloc_addr], _i.e._, -1.
//!     It is a single word, containing the value of the next free page.
//!     It occupies the only page that is not of size 2^32 words.
//! - Page 0 is reserved for non-deterministically initialized memory.
//! - The last full page, number (2^32)-2, starting at address 2^64 - 2Â·(2^32),
//!     is reserved for [static allocations](static_malloc_addr).
//! - All other pages, i.e., pages 1 through (2^32)-3, are dynamically allocated.
//!
//! [prime]: BFieldElement::P
//! [dyn_malloc_addr]: dyn_malloc::DYN_MALLOC_ADDRESS
//! [static_malloc_addr]: crate::library::STATIC_MEMORY_START_ADDRESS
